## Getting Started

### Vagrant

Vagrant is a headless virtual machine that can be run on many different systems.
Vagrant is a safe and easy way to run `phant` without the need to greatly
modify your current system
(see [Why Vagrant?](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/)).

Vagrant Setup:

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
3. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. `git clone https://github.com/sparkfun/phant.git`
5. `cd phant && vagrant up --provision`
6. `phant` is now available via http on port 8080 and telnet via port 8081

To restart phant use `vagrant provision` from inside the `phant` directory.

To stop the vagrant virtual machine use `vagrant halt` from inside the
`phant` directory.

To restart vagrant use `vagrant up --provision` from inside the `phant`
directory.

### Local

phant is a [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) package, and requires the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Once you have node.js installed, you can install phant by running `npm install -g phant` from your favorite terminal.
Using the `-g` (global) flag will make the `phant` executable available in your `PATH`.

Now you can start phant:

```bash
$ phant
phant http server running on port 8080
phant telnet server running on port 8081
```

This launches a [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) server for stream creation, and a http server for data input & output.
You can now open a separate window, and you should be able to create a stream by connecting to the local telnet server.

```
$ telnet localhost 8081
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
